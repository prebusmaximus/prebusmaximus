### G'day to you! ðŸ‘‹

## Hi, my name is Preben, and when I'm not coding or gaming I'm probably out and about ðŸ¥´

As I'm currently freelancing a lot my spare time I dedicate to software projects that have meaning to me. Preferably projects with a mindset of helping me or others perform tasks easier...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on TibWidget, an interface to collect statistics on power consumption from power companies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to behave.. ðŸ¤£
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on small to medium size projects that challenge my skills.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have too many hours in PUBG
