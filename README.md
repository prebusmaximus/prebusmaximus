### G'day to you! 👋

## Hi, my name is Preben, and when I'm not coding or gaming I'm probably out and about 🥴

As I'm currently freelancing a lot my spare time I dedicate to software projects that have meaning to me. Preferably projects with a mindset of helping me or others perform tasks easier...

- 🔭 I’m currently working on TibWidget, an interface to collect statistics on power consumption from power companies. And in parallel I'm working on a opensource (not released yet) project to create an SDK for other people wanting to communicate with Tibber power company API.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to behave.. 🤣
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on small to medium size projects that challenge my skills.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have too many hours in PUBG
